# Spam-Mail-Detector
This project implements a spam detection system using Logistic Regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm. It processes email text data with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like tokenization and TF-IDF vectorization, then classifies messages as spam or ham (not spam) based on learned patterns.
