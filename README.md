# Spam-Mail-Detector
This project implements a spam detection system using Logistic Regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm. It processes email text data with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like tokenization and TF-IDF vectorization, then classifies messages as spam or ham (not spam) based on learned patterns.

# üìß Spam Mail Detector using Logistic Regression
A machine learning project that detects spam emails using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Logistic Regression. This model helps classify incoming messages as either **spam** or **ham** (not spam) based on the content of the email.

## üß† Overview
This project uses:
- **Logistic Regression** for binary classification
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** for feature extraction from text
- **Scikit-learn** and **Pandas** for model building and data processing

  ## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Detects whether an email is spam or not
- Trained on a labeled dataset
- Utilizes text preprocessing and vectorization
- Simple and interpretable model
